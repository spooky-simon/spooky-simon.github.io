# FSAE Aerodynamics

I have a complicated relationship with aero devices on Cooper Union's FSAE cars, and most FSAE cars in general. Aerodynamics as a field and as used in professional motorsports is unimpeachable. It makes all things racing better and faster. In FSAE, it certainly can improve things, but I've seen innumerable cars with immaculate aero that can't pass the technical inspection, often because of the wings. To complicate things further: I built Cooper Union's first set of wings during the summer of my freshman year at Cooper using a gravity-fed hot wire cutter another student and I designed and built in a day. As you can see below, these wings really stressed the "concept" in "proof of concept".

*The very first wings that ever did go on that car*

This being said, I saw aero as an idea grow from an unimplemented senior project to a convoluted mess of foam, plastic, composites, and vinyl that cost the team untold man-hours and had zero imperical data to back it up. Every year, the team dutifully pumped out pretty pressure maps, and colorful flow analyses. Every year, we cut foam, sanded molds, and stuck our big NACA contraption on the back of our racecar. Every year, we promised we would get data to back it up, and every year we didn't. <!--until now haha, ty Aidan-->

Each year I write an email to the team stating the following:

> I believe that a select few people were instrumental in getting the team to focus on aero, and with their graduation, I think it's wise to look at the resources and personnel that the team has at its disposal, especially because even with said dedicated members, the team had issues getting aero finished. This is ever more pressing after covid.

> As an alumni, the most important thing to me is to see the car in person, and to see the team have a fundamental and complete understanding of the work they've done. The simpler the car, the easier this will be, and aero is not necessary for the car to run, or for the car to do well in competition.

> I know it can feel kinda lame to go backwards in terms of technology, and that's definitely something we had to fight when I was on the team. I'm pretty confident that finishing the car earlier and more completely will be more than worth it.

So far, the team has gone ahead and done a full aero package every year.
