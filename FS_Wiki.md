# FS Wiki

Emily Anthony started the <a href="https://fswiki.us">FS Wiki</a> to create an open knowledge sharing platform for the Formula Student and FSAE community. I encourage all FSAE compeititors who will listen to use the site and contribute when they can.

This project aligns very closely with my personal approach to engineering and student competition. I have been a strong advocate, long-time user, and frequent contributor. I have added the majority of the IC powertrain content on the site <!--(possibly to the detriment of all users lol)--> as well as information regarding data collection, analysis, and visualization. I have shared a large quantity of data that was taken when I was in college as examples for students to use.

I have found that this style of documentation helps me organize my thoughts and cement my understanding of these systems. By writing it down, I am forced to put my intuition, experience, and history with these systems into words. Organizing my thoughts like this ensures I have a good grasp on the fundamentals of the systems I am writing about.

I am particularly proud of the <a href="https://fswiki.us/Intake">intake design</a> page for its completeness and the collaborative effort made by the community. Another point of pride is the graphics I made for the pages for <a href="https://fswiki.us/Tensioner">chain tensioning</a> and <a href="https://fswiki.us/Throttle">throttle design</a>.

*I had a lot of fun with this one*

The grahics for the pages were made in inkscape, a free design software that can be found here: <a href= "https://inkscape.org/">https://inkscape.org/<a>
