# FSAE

I have participated in FSAE since 2015, initially as a competitor and now as a mentor to my former team and volunteer tech inspector.

## FSWiki

Emily Anthony started the <a href="https://fswiki.us">FS Wiki</a> to create an open knowledge sharing platform for the Formula Student and FSAE community. I encourage all FSAE compeititors who will listen to use the site and contribute when they can.

This project aligns very closely with my personal approach to engineering and student competition. I have been a strong advocate, long-time user, and frequent contributor. I have added the majority of the IC powertrain content on the site <!--(possibly to the detriment of all users lol)--> as well as information regarding data collection, analysis, and visualization. I have shared a large quantity of data that was taken when I was in college as examples for students to use.

I am particularly proud of the <a href="https://fswiki.us/Intake">intake design</a> page for its completeness and the collaborative effort made by the community. Another point of pride is the graphics I made for the pages for <a href="https://fswiki.us/Tensioner">chain tensioning</a> and <a href="https://fswiki.us/Throttle">throttle design</a>.

The grahics for the pages were made in inkscape, a free design software that can be found here: <a href= "https://inkscape.org/">https://inkscape.org/<a>

## Alumni Outlook and Accomplishments

### Aero

I have a complicated relationship with aero devices on Cooper Union's FSAE cars, and most FSAE cars in general. Aerodynamics as a field and as used in professional motorsports is neigh unimpeachable. It;s like a magic sauce sprinkled to make everything better and faster. To complicate things further: I built Cooper Union's first set of wings during the summer of my freshman year at Cooper with a gravity-fed hot wire cutter me and another student designed and built in a day. As you can see below, these wings really stressed the "concept" in "proof of concept"

![A picture of Simon lying next to the wings described above. The wings are blue and sanwiched between plywood end plates. Ben is leaning over them pointing. His face is obscured for privacy and "BEN" is written over it](/docs/assets/wings_v1.jpg)
*The very first wings that ever did go on that car*

This being said, I saw aero as an idea grow from an unimplemented senior project to a convoluted mess of foam, plastic, composites, and vinyl that cost the team untold man-hours and had zero imperical data to back it up. Every year, the team dutifully pumped out pretty pressure maps, and colorful flow analyses. Every year, we cut foam, sanded molds, and stuck our big NACA contraption on the back of our racecar. Every year, we promised we would get data to back it up, and every year we didn't. (until now haha, ty Aidan).

Each year I write an email to the team stating the following: I believe that a select few people were instrumental in getting the team to focus on aero, and with their graduation, I think it's wise to look at the resources and personnel that the team has at its disposal, especially because even with said dedicated members, the team had issues getting aero finished. This is ever more pressing after covid.

As an alumni, the most important thing to me is to see the car in person, and to see the team have a fundamental and complete understanding of the work they've done. The simpler the car, the easier this will be, and aero is not necessary for the car to run, or for the car to do well in competition.

I know it can feel kinda lame to go backwards in terms of technology, and that's definitely something we had to fight when I was on the team. I'm pretty confident that finishing the car earlier and more completely will be more than worth it.

## The Glory Days

### 2019 Season: Powertrain Lead

*The 2019 car at the last test day before competition. Rain is pouring, the ground is wet. The engine is screaming. Life is good. Note: Aero is not on the car, as it had not been finished.* 

As a senior, I was given the job to lead the powertrain subsystem. Having never worked in powertrain in FSAE before, my approach was to make sure the work we did under my direction was bulletproof. I focused on documentation, data collection, and knowledge transfer.

To ensure we were rigorous in our engineering design cycle, we have to identify the problem. Our problem? Well, in 2018, we didn't finish the competition, so our points scoring ability was greatly diminished. To ensure our points scoring ability is absolutely maximized, we have to finish every race. This means we have our car has to start when asked, and keep going until asked to stop.

Reliability is one of those design goals that is really hard to quantify. It's only ever truly assessed after the race, meaning its too vague of a goal to use to design. The way reliability is designed for is to run someting until it breaks, look at what breaks and fix it. This can be very hard if your budget is small. We were not in the position to run the engine until it broke. WHat we could do is run the engine as often as possible. With some good engineering judgment, low hanging fruit can be picked up and solved.

Our team had a history of inconsistent throttle performance. Even glancing at the throttle body could send an engineer into convulsions, so the picture below will be pixelated so I will not be liable for your hospital bill.

*I am sorry to report it looks even worse in person.* 

This throttle body had been in use since before 2016, but it looks like it was built on Dr. Frankenstein's workbench right next to his monster. It was an aluminum lip epoxied to a mutilated single cylinder motorcycle throttle body. A custom throttle cable retainer was screwed on as an afterthought. The cable was retained with a bolt. The tps only fit by grace of god. How does one begin to untangle this Gordian knot? Ignore it and buy a COTS throttle body.

*A decision rarely seen in FSAE*

Further trailblazing, I decided to switch from bicycle brake cable to steel cabling from McMaster Carr. To secure the cable at each end, I machined a custom swageless fitting on the pedal end, and a threaded tube through which the cable is threaded and pinched between two set screws. This ensured the failure mode of the system was slipping of the cable instead of over-centering or breaking the throttle body itself.

Now that the driver could actually control the throttle, we could drill deeper.

<!--
We broke the system into smaller systems: Intake, Engine, Exhaust, Drivetrain, and Shifter.

Accomplishments: testing, documentation, building knowledge base.
