# FSAE

I have participated in FSAE since 2015, initially as a competitor and now as a mentor to my former team and volunteer tech inspector.

## FSWiki

Emily Anthony started the <a href=fswiki.us/>FS Wiki</a> to create an open knowledge sharing platform for the Formula Student and FSAE community. I encourage all FSAE compeititors who will listen to use the site and contribute when they can.

This project aligns very closely with my personal approach to engineering and student competition. I have been a strong advocate, long-time user, and frequent contributor. I have added the majority of the IC powertrain content on the site <!--(possibly to the detriment of all users lol)--> as well as information regarding data collection, analysis, and visualization. I have shared a large quantity of data that was taken when I was in college as examples for students to use.
