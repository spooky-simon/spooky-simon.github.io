# FSAE

I have participated in FSAE since 2015, initially as a competitor and now as a mentor to my former team and volunteer tech inspector.

## FSWiki

Emily Anthony started the <a href="https://fswiki.us">FS Wiki</a> to create an open knowledge sharing platform for the Formula Student and FSAE community. I encourage all FSAE compeititors who will listen to use the site and contribute when they can.

This project aligns very closely with my personal approach to engineering and student competition. I have been a strong advocate, long-time user, and frequent contributor. I have added the majority of the IC powertrain content on the site <!--(possibly to the detriment of all users lol)--> as well as information regarding data collection, analysis, and visualization. I have shared a large quantity of data that was taken when I was in college as examples for students to use.

## Alumni Outlook and Accomplishments

### Suspension: Winning the battle, after losing the war

My senior year FSAE competition ended anticlimactically. Our car failed 3 laps into endurance after our lower control arm buckled, leading to a failed steering rack, and an undriveable car. The puzzling part: there's a bend right in the middle of the lower aft link. The car was rounding a slow corner, maybe 0.3-0.5 g of lateral acceleration. We were all stumped. I got another crack at the problem after graduating, unfortunately too late to finish endurance, but I can finally sleep at night.

### Aero

I have a complicated relationship with aero devices on Cooper Union's FSAE cars, and most FSAE cars in general. In FSAE, it certainly can improve things, but I can't count how many cars with immaculate aero that can't pass the technical inspection, often because of the wings.

## The Glory Days

### 2019 Season: Powertrain Lead

*The 2019 car at the last test day before competition. Rain is pouring, the ground is wet. The engine is screaming. Life is good. Note: Aero is not on the car, as it had not been finished.* 

As a senior, I was given the job to lead the powertrain subsystem. Having never worked in powertrain in FSAE before, my approach was to make sure the work we did under my direction was bulletproof. I focused on documentation, data collection, and knowledge transfer.

### 2018 Season: President
