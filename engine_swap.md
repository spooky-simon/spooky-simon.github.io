# Engine Swap

## Original Engine

The car when puchased came with the factory 2.8L V6 engine with about 130,000 miles on it. It ran, sounded great, didn't knock, and the oil came out clean on the dipstick. That says "mint" to me. The stock intake plenum was missing, and had been replaced by a length of corrugated plastic tubing. This contributed an aftermarket whistling sound and a possible, but unlikely reduction in horsepower.

The original engine made 140hp stock. Judging by the richness of exhaust and the occaisional blue plume, I'm not getting that 140 out of it. I replaced the spark plugs and spark plug wires in late 2021 at about 135k miles. This got rid of all the sputters and pops when letting off the throttle that the car commmunity likes so much.

It just so happens that appetites have grown since 1987 and as a product of my time, I gotta give it more beans.

## Donor Engine

The quintessential Fiero swap is a 3800 from the string of late 90s to mid 2000s sedans like the Buick Regal or Pontiac Grand Prix. The NA 3800 puts down just over 200hp. These can be found with a factory supercharger that bumps it up to about 250. These engines are widely regarded as one of the better american engines of this generation, if not of all time. The iron block is sturdy, not prone to dramatic failure, can withstand a beating. It is ubiquitous enough to make modification and repair cheap, as well as support a flourishing aftermarket for modifications.

With my limited budget of $2000, I decided to go for a donor car rather than a donor engine. I thought I would be able to get the engine, trans, harness and accessories for the cost of an ebay engine itself. This was both right and wrong. The cars in my budget were all high mileage, and none that had the supercharged GTP trim were road worthy. In February of 2022, I settled on a red 2002 Grand Prix GT with 238,000 miles on the clock, which was high, but the car was in decent shape, and test drove well.

The engine had a suspected coolant leak, and a suspected oil leak. I neglected to root cause the issue as I was already planning to do a near-ocmplete teardown and rebuild of the engine. When tearing it down, there was a prominent lip in the engine casting at the oil pan interface. 

## Tear down and Rebuild

I was taught in school and by experience that whenever you buy a used engine, you have to tear it down before you use it. You never know the condition of these magic black boxes. Who knows what traps and dangers may reside within?

I borrowed and engine picker and stand from my neighbor and got to work.

Once on the stand, I invited a few friends over. It turns out dropping an engine into the middle of a pack of mechanical engineers looks eerily similar to dropping a nice juicy steak into a tank of pirhanas. I don't have any pictures because it was over before I could take my phone out of my pocket.

As expected for an engine that had 238,000 miles under it's belt, some things had seen better days. The pistons were covered in crust, and there was distict evidence of blowby and crud (which i believe is the technical term). The rings were old news, and the carbon deposits looked like someone trying to season a cast iron pan.
