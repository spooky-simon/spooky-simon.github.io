# Goals

Step 1 in the engineering design process is always to figure out the problem. In this case, my problem can only be defined once I actually know what I want. I guess this is step 0 in the engineering design process.

I already have a relable daily driver, so there's no need to keep it road-worthy all the time, so my scope can be quite large.
<ul>
<li> Comfort is a non-issue for the moment. </li>
<li> Audio? supplied by the engine</li>
	<ul><li>plus I need to be able to diagnose critical squeaks, rattles, bumps, dings, pops, bangs, and assorted other NVH and BSR). Performance?</li></ul>
<li> Performance? as much as is reasonable. This means we can ignore the need for sound dampening and other frivolities.
<li> Passenger comfort? I want the car to feel like you just might not come out of the drive totally intact, or totally sane, so we don't want any passenger comfort.

After taking a quick peak at the quality, or lack thereof, that came with the car, I settled on  gutting the interior, reminiscent of home brew rally racers (flocked dash not included).

# Teardown

Step 1 of the engineering design process is figuring out the problem, or as Mao says: When you have investigated the problem thoroughly, you will know how to solve it. I am not investigating pre-communist China, but the principle holds. 

My investigation consisted largely of taking stuff out of the car, looking at it, and saying one of two things: "huh, that sucks" or "wow, this car is old".
