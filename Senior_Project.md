In my senior year of college (fall 2018 - Spring 2019) I teamed up with my two good friends and at-the-time captains of the FSAE team to triple dip a single project for the school year. Our goal: A single project that we could submit to our professors as a capstone worthy project, a project requirement for a design class, and as work we could showcase at the FSAE competition in May. The plan: turbocharge our Honda CBR600RR that we used to the FSAE car.

I will spoil it for you: we had mixed success. Our project was accepted under strict conditions by our senior project advisor and by our design professor. The restriction was that we would have to make distinct contributions to the project for one that could not count as work submitted for the other. We never got a running prototype but I think we cleared significant hurdles along the way.
