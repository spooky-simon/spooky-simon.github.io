# Capstone Project

In my senior year of college (fall 2018 - Spring 2019) I teamed up with my two good friends and at-the-time captains of the FSAE team to triple dip a single project for the school year. Our goal: A single project that we could submit to our professors as a capstone worthy project, a project requirement for a design class, and as work we could showcase at the FSAE competition in May. The plan: turbocharge our Honda CBR600RR that we used to power the FSAE car.

I will spoil it for you: we had mixed success. Our project was accepted under strict conditions by our senior project advisor and by our design professor. The restriction was that we would have to make distinct contributions to the project for one that could not count as work submitted for the other. We never got a running prototype but I think we cleared significant hurdles along the way.

We were not trailblazing here. Multiple other teams have published extensive papers on successful implementations of this idea. Notably: Cornell and Wisconsin (who turbocharged a single cylinder). We had a few speedbumps to overcome before we could even get started: none of us had a strong foundation on boosted combustion vehicles, none of us had a strong foundation on dyno operating and tuning, we had a non-functional dynamometer to begin with, and our engine was leaking. Despite these small inconveniences, we were unfazed.

As powertrain lead of the FSAE team <a href="Formula.html">that year</a>, it fell upon me to get our engine in running order and our dyno functional. The engine leak was a gasket issue, of course, but that was only discovered after a complete teardown. The dyno was more troublesome. First I found numerous issues with the aging harness. Then the signal to the computers was being routed through stranded wires plugged into what looked like a 12 cent breadboard. We were starting and running the engine with a battery that would run out of charge frequently. Once I got it running, I learned that if you mis-wire the fuel injectors, the intake will explode, very fun.
