<h2>Suspension</h2>
Forum post on suspension stage upgrades<br><br>

Stage 1: Freshen up the current suspension. New joints (including inner and outer tie rods), new bearings, new bushings, new shocks/struts, new swaybar endlinks...everything. Don't forget the cradle bushings...those are far more important than many realize, and can be changed to poly or aluminum. Some of my preferences for this stage are Rodney's joints, KYB shocks/struts, poly endlinks, rubber a-arm bushings...others may have other preferences, and I won't claim mine are better than theirs. This is where my car is at right now...and it made a world of difference.<br><br>

Stage 1.5: Springs. If you are going to do springs, might as well do them with Stage 1....so much easier than going back and doing them later. This is also where you should consider the ride height you want...and possibly consider Rodney's lowering ball joints if that is your choice. Eibachs are a nice choice...but there are other options. This is where you should consider rear coil-overs as well.. I chose to stick with stock WS6 springs on mine because I didn't want to lower it, and I drive on real roads so I didn't see the need to stiffen it further.<br><br>

Stage 2: Sway bars. Stock doesn't have a rear swaybar...but it could use one. Generally, when you add one, you want to upgrade the front swaybar as well. There are several options...but the most common are Fiero Store, Adco...or if you want to go all out you could get the HPP. Remember that spring rate and sway bars will strongly affect the balance of the car, and is generally used to tune over/under steer (if you want the front to grip more, you stiffen the rear...and vice versa).<br><br>

Stage 3: Bump steer correction. Options here include an 88 cradle and rear suspension....or the Fiero Store/Arraut Motorsports kit...or other custom options. Of course, if you are going to the 88 rear suspension, you are forced to use coil-overs, and the sway bar options change.<br><br>

Stage 4: Go crazy with the front suspension. Limited choices here. Either we are going totally custom...or we can go to just front coil-overs (I think Arraut Motorsports may be the only option still out there for coilovers)...or we can go all out with the Arraut Motorsports Slalom front suspension.<br><br>

If money were no object, my car would have the 88 rear suspension, Arraut Motorsports slalom front suspension, QA1 coilovers front and back, and HPP sway bars front and back. But...money IS an object, so I am currently sitting at Stage 1.<br><br>

Also remember that beyond Stage 1 or 2, tires will make a bigger difference than suspension changes.<br><br> 

Other ideas:<br>
After doing some research (I work for GM, that certainly helps ) I found that a rear "HUB ASSEMBLY" Off a 91-96 Grand prix will bolt onto the rear knuckle of our cars. Now, with a caliper mounting adapter, that will give us 3 things. A larger rotor. A larger bolt pattern (which means ya cant keep the stock wheels). And an ABS sensor. Damn, we are halfway there.<br><br>
