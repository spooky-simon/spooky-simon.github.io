# Fiero Suspension

## Stock Points

As stated 100 other times on this site, we have to figure out what we're working with before we start to make changes.

### The Plan

We have to ensure the wheels are level, my driveway is certainly not. I will shim the wheel with bits of ply and check with a laser level. After making sure we're on level ground (so to speak), I'll paintakingly measure the x,y,z positions of every pickup point on the car. Not looking forward to the process, but looking forward to the results.

Because the rera suspension is a backwards MacPherson strut, I'll need the same points for the front and rear, somewhat simplifying things. The points I'll need to get are the following:

<!--
| Point |
|-------|
| Upper Chassis |
| Upper Upright |
| Wheel Center |
| Lower Upright |
| Lower Chassis Fore |
| Lower Chassis Aft |
| Steering Arm Inboard |
| Steering Arm Outboard |
-->
* Upper Chassis 
* Upper Upright 
* Wheel Center 
* Lower Upright
* Lower Chassis Fore 
* Lower Chassis Aft
* Steering Arm Inboard
* Steering Arm Outboard
