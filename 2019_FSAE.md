# 2019 FSAE Competition

To ensure we were rigorous in our engineering design cycle, we have to identify the problem. Our problem? Well, in 2018, we didn't finish the competition, so our points scoring ability was greatly diminished. To ensure our points scoring ability is absolutely maximized, we have to finish every race. This means we have our car has to start when asked, and keep going until asked to stop.

Reliability is one of those design goals that is really hard to quantify. It's only ever truly assessed after the race, meaning its too vague of a goal to use to design. The way reliability is designed for is to run someting until it breaks, look at what breaks and fix it. This can be very hard if your budget is small. We were not in the position to run the engine until it broke. WHat we could do is run the engine as often as possible. With some good engineering judgment, low hanging fruit can be picked up and solved.

Our team had a history of inconsistent throttle performance. Even glancing at the throttle body could send an engineer into convulsions, so the picture below will be pixelated so I will not be liable for your hospital bill.

*I am sorry to report it looks even worse in person.* 

This throttle body had been in use since before 2016, but it looks like it was built on Dr. Frankenstein's workbench right next to his monster. It was an aluminum lip epoxied to a mutilated single cylinder motorcycle throttle body. A custom throttle cable retainer was screwed on as an afterthought. The cable was retained with a bolt. The tps only fit by grace of god. How does one begin to untangle this Gordian knot? Ignore it and buy a COTS throttle body.

![Text message exchange that reads (grey text) I think it can be salvaged if Bryan welds up the crack and then Iâ€™ll modify the D shaft where the TPS was connected to accept the new TPS which is metal and not garbage plastic (blue text) I'm just going to buy a new one](/docs/assets/buy_a_new_one.jpg)
*A decision rarely seen in FSAE*

Further trailblazing, I decided to switch from bicycle brake cable to steel cabling from McMaster Carr. To secure the cable at each end, I machined a custom swageless fitting on the pedal end, and a threaded tube through which the cable is threaded and pinched between two set screws. This ensured the failure mode of the system was slipping of the cable instead of over-centering or breaking the throttle body itself.

Now that the driver could actually control the throttle, we could drill deeper.

We broke the system into smaller systems: Intake, Engine, Exhaust, Drivetrain, and Shifter.

Accomplishments: testing, documentation, building knowledge base.
