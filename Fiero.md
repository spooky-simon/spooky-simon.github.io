## Engine Swap

### Original Engine

The car when puchased came with the factory 2.8L V6 engine with about 130,000 miles on it. The stock intake plenum was missing, and had been replaced by a length of corrugated plastic tubing. This contributed an aftermarket whistling sound and a possible, but unlikely reduction in horsepower.

The original engine made 140hp stock. Judging by the richness of exhaust and the occaisional blue plume, I'm not getting that 140 out of it. I replaced the spark plugs and spark plug wires in late 2021 at about 135k miles. This got rid of all the sputters and pops when letting off the throttle that the car commmunity likes so much.
