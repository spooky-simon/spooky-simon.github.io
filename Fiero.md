## Engine Swap

### Original Engine

The car when puchased came with the factory 2.8L V6 engine. The stock intake plenum was missing, and had been replaced by a length of corrugated plastic tubing. This contributed an aftermarket whistling sound and a possible, but unlikely reduction in horsepower.

 no known issues, replaced spark plugs and distributor wires late 2021@ ~135k miles
