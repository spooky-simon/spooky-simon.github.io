*Simon and the Fiero*

## Background

During the global pandemic, I picked up a project car. Unfortunately, I was late enough to the party to get caught in the extreme rising tide of used car prices. To add insult to injury, my personal taste in cars runs from the retro to the goofy. The only intersection of my budget and my proclivity for pop-up headlights was the much maligned Pontiac Fiero. Having worked extensively on the mid-engine Corvette at GM, the idea of owning its spiritual predecessor made it hard to say no.

I picked up a blue 1987 GT from facebook marketplace. It had over 20,000 miles more than my daily camry, but it was small, sounded great, and had almost no rust. I was told it needed a new set of brake pads, but was relatively impressed by it's condition. The previous owner had tried his best to install an aftermarket audio system, and 2 layers of seat covers.

This being my first project, I decided the best move was to bring it home, fix all the small issues, and just take things slow. This did not happen...

## Interior

The first thing I was able to sink my teeth into was "fixing up" the interior. I had and have no interest in restoring this car, Fiero's were never viewed as an interior design success. Most of it was uphostered in the same carpet that the cubicles of the '80s were.

## Engine Swap

Not benig able to break the rear tires free may partially be a result of the automatic transmission, but can be solved with more juice.
